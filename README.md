This is a personal project that i hope to just host localy on the computers at work, so that if people need help / have questions about the dashboard or how the MS Access system works then they can inform themselves and troubleshoot their own problems.

It contains information for:
- MS Access
  - What it is
  - How it works
  - How to use my system (forms)
- Specific procedures
  - Distributor ticketing
  - End of Day
  - Reporting for EOM
- Other miscellaneous information which may be of some value to know


## IDEAS
- inlcude videos for processes such as selling combo tickets
- include links and downloads for roster print offs and other important documents
- detailed instructions on how to make and edit a report in MS access.
- what to do if ms access becomes corrupted
